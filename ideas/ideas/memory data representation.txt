	One's complement
		If above 127 (if the most significant bit [the largest bit] is set) the number the number the number is negative and inverted to obtain the full number.
		Ex:  126 (01111110) and -126 (10000001).  0 can be positive (00000000) or negative (11111111)
	Two's complement
		Starting from the least significant bit look for the first 1 and invert all larger bits that one.
		Again only used if it the most significant bit is set to on (1).  This allows numbers from +0 to 127 and -1 to -128 to be used.
		This eliminates the positive and negative 0s and only has a positive.
	Excess N (also Biased representation)
		Used for floating point numbers mostly.  Possibly used to ensure a positive exponent.
		If value is â‰¥ N the value is positive, otherwise if value < N it is negative.
		The smallest number is 0-N
		The largest number is 2 to the Nth power minus N - 1
		Easily converted to sign and magnitude by subtracting the exponent from N

Ints vs Chars
	The only difference is the storage space.
	Both can be used to output characters and both can be used to output numbers.

Big endian
