mathematics, a logarithm is the "inverse function" of raising a number to a power. A simpler example of an inverse function is division, which is the inverse of multiplication. Asking "What is 8 divided by 4?" is the same as asking "What number makes 8 when you multiply 4 by it?" Similarly, if I asked "What is the logarithm of 9, base 3?" it's the same as asking "What number makes 9 when you raise 3 to it?" Since 3^2, or 3*3, is 9, the answer is 2.

log of x:
base^s=x
s is the answer
